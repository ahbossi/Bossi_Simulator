# Bossi_Simulator
[Shiny app simulator](http://ahbossi.shinyapps.io/Bossi_Simulator) designed to explore maximum oxygen uptake (V̇O<sub>2max</sub>) responses to training. The purpose is to challenge the widespread use of the 'responder counting approach' by allowing users to manipulate various parameters and observe the resulting distributions.

This simulator was originally conceptualised by Dr Arthur Henrique Bossi with the intent of serving the sport and exercise academic community. While it provides a robust foundation for training response simulations, there is substantial room for improvement. One area where contributions would be particularly beneficial is the incorporation of intra-individual variability in V̇O<sub>2max</sub> responses, which has not yet been addressed. Researchers and developers who are interested in improving the functionality and accuracy of this tool are therefore encouraged to contribute.
